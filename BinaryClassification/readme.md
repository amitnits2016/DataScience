This project is intended to be a walkthrough on the development of a machine learning project **from end to end**.

This is achieved with a **supervised machine learning classification** model that is able to predict the Trouble Ticket generated is actionable or not.

The Project consists of the following steps:

1. [Exploratory Data Analysis]()
3. [Feature Engineering]()
4. [Model Training]()
